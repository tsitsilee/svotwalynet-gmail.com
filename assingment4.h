assingment4h - interface file for a program named assignment4
======================================================

This program is for Assignment No. 4, Course 04-630 Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers. 

Please refer to the application file - assingment2pplication.cpp - for details of the functionality of this program


File organization
-----------------

assingment4h  :interface file:      
contains the declarations required to use the functions that implement the solution to this problem
typically, these will include the definitions of the abstract data types used in the implementation

assingment4mplementation.cpp  implementation file: 
contains the definitions of the functions that implement the algorithm used in the implementation

assingment4pplication.cpp     application file:    
contains the code that instantiates the abstract data types and calls the associated functions
in order to effect the required functionality for this application
