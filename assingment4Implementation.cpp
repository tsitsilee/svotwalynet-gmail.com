assingment4Implementation.cpp - implementation file for a program named assingment4
============================================================================

This program is for Assignment No. 4, Course 04-630 Data Structures and Algorithms for Engineers. 


Pseudocode
----------
put the input.txt file in the data folder
read the file 
while reading the file using a for loop to read the number of test cases and the while loop to read the values
where there is a negative value on t replace with ------------------
create a structure of array to store values
once stored sort the values per each test case using the bubble sort {
whenit sorts it puts the value to be sorted in a temp location then replaces it with the other value then put that value to the new location
once done print to output file
after testing remove the prompt 


add the poisondistribution function and reuse code
adjust it to suit my needs for this assingment 
add the signature to the header file

%complexity of bubble sort
the order of complexity is big O of n^2 and this is because we have a for loop inside a for loop which makes it n by n making it n^2
this is because the if statement is only checked once therefor giving the time complaxity of 1 and therefor not affecting

testing
---------
to test if the bubble sort was working and how it was working I put a for loop just before the terminating brace 
when sing size-1 in the implementation file it was omiting the last values therefor I decided to remove the -1 part 
and implement it in the application file when calling the bubble sort
